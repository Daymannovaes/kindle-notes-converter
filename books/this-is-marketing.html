Marketing is the act of making change happen. Making is insufficient. You haven’t made an impact until you’ve changed someone.

Just as a movie is a problem, so is the story of your marketing. It has to resonate with the listener, to tell them something they’ve been waiting to hear, something they’re open to believing.

<div class="noteText">
In this book, we’re working together to solve a set of related problems. How to spread your ideas. How to make the impact you seek. How to improve the culture. There isn’t an obvious road map. No simple step-by-step series of tactics. But what I can promise you is a compass: a true north. A recursive method that will get better the more you use it.

Shameless marketers brought shame to the rest of us

<div class="noteText">
The other kind of marketing, the effective kind, is about understanding our customers’ worldview and desires so we can connect with them. It’s focused on being missed when you’re gone, on bringing more than people expect to those who trust us. It seeks volunteers, not victims.

And now I have a compass for what marketing is today, about the human condition, and about our culture. This approach is simple, but it’s not easy to embrace, because it involves patience, empathy, and respect.

This Is Marketing: An executive summary
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 259
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Marketers don’t use consumers to solve their company’s problem; they use marketing to solve other people’s problems. They have the empathy to know that those they seek to serve don’t want what the marketer wants, don’t believe what they believe, and don’t care about what they care about. They probably never will.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 272
</div>
<div class="noteText">
If you want to make change, begin by making culture. Begin by organizing a tightly knit group. Begin by getting people in sync. Culture beats strategy—so much that culture is strategy.

<div class="noteText">
Most of us wouldn’t want a pair of used glasses; we’d want the fancy new ones. Even if “used” simply meant tried on once before. But it’s not helpful to imagine that everyone knows what you know, wants what you want, believes what you believe.

<div class="noteText">
Using a product, engaging with a service. Making a donation, going to a rally, calling customer service. Each of these actions is part of the story; each builds a little bit of our connection. As marketers, we can offer these experiences with intent, doing them on purpose.

Organize your project, your life, and your organization around the minimum. What’s the smallest market you can survive on? Once you’ve identified the scale, then find a corner of the market that can’t wait for your attention. Go to their extremes. Find a position on the map where you, and you alone, are the perfect answer. Overwhelm this group’s wants and dreams and desires with your care, your attention, and your focus. Make change happen. Change that’s so profound, people can’t help but talk about it.
